# Medical Bills Entry App v1.0.0
 >App to quickly make entries of medical claims/receipts into a pre-formatted, pre-filled Excel database.

## Requirements:
>- icecream~=2.1.0
>- PyQt5~=5.15.2
>- openpyxl~=3.0.6

## Description:
>- This is a receipt entry app(will be expanded with more capabilities) that makes use of two specific *pre-formatted*
and *pre-filled* databases. It was custom-made to meet the needs of a nurse at a specific organization and most of the
reading and writing operations are **rigid** and will only work properly given the right databases and environments in Excel.

>- It makes use of **two** databases: `STAFF DEPENDANT LIST yyyy.xlsx` and `MEDICAL BILLS yyyy.xlsx`(yyyy => Current Year).
   > The former database contains all the staff names, their spouses, and their children (if they have any) with special spacing,
> while the latter database contains the actual information entered through the app with staff names **only**.\
   > The "actual information" stored here is just the amount of money spent on medical bills by a staff, his/her spouse
   > or children for a given month.
