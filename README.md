>- PyQt5~=5.15.2
>- openpyxl~=3.0.6
>- cx-Freeze~=6.6

## Description:
> This is a receipt entry app that makes use of two specific *pre-formatted*
and *pre-filled* databases. It was custom-made to meet the needs of a nurse at a specific organization and most of the
reading and writing operations are **rigid** and will only work properly, given the right databases and
environments in **MS Excel**.

## NB:
> The actual databases used cannot be released **publicly** as they contain **private** information. They'll have to
be edited before releasing. It should be known that the app **depends heavily** on the databases to function at all.
